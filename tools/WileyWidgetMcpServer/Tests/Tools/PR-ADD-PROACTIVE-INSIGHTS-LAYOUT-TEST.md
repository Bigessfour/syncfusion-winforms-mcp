# ProactiveInsightsPanel Layout Test

Adds an EvalCSharp-based test that validates header minimum height, grid layout, and that the loading overlay covers the data grid. This test follows the EvoCSharp/TestHelper pattern and is intended to run on a Windows host where WinForms and Syncfusion assemblies are available.
